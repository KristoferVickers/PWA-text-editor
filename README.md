## Description

Okay I know this looks very odd to have all my work in one commit but this code was from my instructor. He instead of doing the mini project last week walked over the weeks challenge instead. So I imagine this will be worth nothing which is fine but figured I would say something if he did not. None of this code is mine all of it is from my instructor in the course.

## User Story


```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```


## Acceptance Criteria
 
```md
GIVEN a text editor web application
WHEN I open my application in my editor
THEN I should see a client server folder structure

THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
WHEN I run my webpack plugins
THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
